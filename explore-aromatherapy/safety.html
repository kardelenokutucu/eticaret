<p><small>Safety involves a state of being free from risk or occurrence of injury, harm, or danger. Individuals who practice aromatherapy need to be aware of the safety issues involved with using essential oils in order to avoid potential adverse effects. According to Burfield, &ldquo;<em>Although many essential oils are potentially hazardous materials, if handled in the appropriate manner, the risks involved in their use can be very small. So therefore, most commercially offered essential oils are safe to use for the purpose intended in a domestic/ professional or clinical environment.</em>&rdquo;<sup><a href="#reference-1">1</a></sup>"The informed use of essential oils may create occasional irritation or minor discomfort, but it is extremely unlikely to create serious injury or lasting physical problems",<sup><a href="#reference-2">2</a></sup> particularly when basic guidelines are followed.</small></p>

<h2 class="card-title">Factors that influence the safety of essential oils include</h2>
</header>

<div class="list-group list-group-flush">
<div class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning flex-column align-items-start">
<h5 class="mb-1">Quality of essential oil being utilized</h5>

<p class="mb-1">Adulterated essential oils increase the likelihood of an adverse response and hence the need for pure, authentic, and genuine essential oils is of the utmost importance.</p>
</div>

<div class="list-group-item-warning list-group-item flex-column align-items-start">
<h5 class="mb-1">Chemical composition of the oil</h5>

<p>Essential oils rich in aldehydes (e.g., citronellal, citral) and phenols (e.g., cinnamic aldehyde, eugenol) may cause skin reactions. Essential oils rich in these constituents should always be diluted prior to application to the skin. According to Schnaubelt, &ldquo;diluting such oils so that the resulting solution becomes non-irritant, may require diluting them to concentrations much lower than in normal circumstances. Another option is to blend such irritant oils asymmetrically with other essential oils, which mitigate their irritant effects.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#reference-3">3</a></sup></p>
</div>

<div class="list-group-item-warning list-group-item flex-column align-items-start">
<h5 class="mb-1">Method of application</h5>

<p>Essential oils may be applied on the skin (dermal application), inhaled, diffused or taken internally. Each of these methods have safety issues which need to be considered. The potential safety concerns with dermal application will be discussed below. With regard to inhalation, from a safety standpoint, inhalation presents a very low level of risk to most people. Even in a relatively small closed room, and assuming 100% evaporation, the concentration of any essential oil (or component thereof) is unlikely to reach a dangerous level, either from aromatherapy massage, or from essential oil vaporization.<sup><a href="#reference-4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Tisserand and Balacs further point out that &ldquo;the only likely risk would be from prolonged exposure (perhaps 1 hour or more) to relatively high levels of essential oil vapor which could lead to headaches, vertigo, nausea and lethargy&rdquo;. With regard to internal use, NAHA does not support the indiscriminate internal use of essential oils. <strong><a href="https://naha.org/explore-aromatherapy/safety/naha-safety-statements/">Click here for more information</a></strong>.</p>
</div>

<div class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning flex-column align-items-start">
<h5 class="mb-1">Dosage/dilution to be applied</h5>

<p>Most aromatherapy oil based blends will be between 1 and 5 percent dilutions, which typically does not represent a safety concern. As one increases dilution, potential dermal (skin) reactions may take place depending on the individual essential oil, the area in which the oil is applied, and other factors related to the client&rsquo;s own sensitivity levels. Any excessive usage of essential oils may cause irritation or other undesired effects due to their lipophilic nature.<sup><a href="#reference-5">5</a></sup></p>
</div>

<div class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning flex-column align-items-start">
<h5 class="mb-1">Integrity of skin</h5>

<p>Damaged, diseased, or inflamed skin is often more permeable to essential oils and may be more sensitive to dermal reactions. It is potentially dangerous to put undiluted essential oils on to damaged, diseased or inflamed skin. Under these circumstances the skin condition may be worsened, and larger amounts of oil than normal will be absorbed. Sensitization reactions are also more likely to occur.<sup><a href="#reference-6">6</a></sup></p>
</div>

<div class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning flex-column align-items-start">
<h5 class="mb-1">Age of client</h5>

<p>Infants, toddlers, and young children are more sensitive to the potency of essential oils and safe dilutions generally range from 0.5 - 2.5% depending on the condition. Certain essential oils should either be avoided, used in highly diluted form under the guidance of a knowledgeable professional, or included as a minor percentage in a professionally-formulated essential oil blend. For example, special caution should be exercised with potentially toxic essential oils such as Birch and Wintergreen which are both high in methyl salicylate, Eucalyptus which is high in 1,8 cineole and Peppermint which is high in menthol. Elderly clients may have more skin sensitivities so a reduced concentration/dilution may be indicated.</p>

<p class="card-text">Of primary importance to the aromatherapists is the safety of essential oil application to the skin. Dermal or skin reactions that may occur with essential oils include: irritation, sensitization and phototoxicity/photosensitization.</p>

<div class="tab-content">

<h3 class="card-subtitle">Dermal irritant</h3>

<p>A dermal irritant will produce an immediate effect of irritation on the skin. The reaction will be represented on the skin as blotchy or redness, which may be painful to some individuals. The severity of the reaction will depend on the concentration (dilution) applied.</p>

<p>General safety guidelines include: avoid application of known dermal irritant essential oils on any inflammatory or allergic skin condition; avoid undiluted application; avoid application on open or damaged skin; and dilute known dermal irritants with appropriate vegetable oil or other carrier. If you suspect a client has sensitive skin, perform a skin patch test. Table 1 lists some common essential oils considered to be dermal irritants.</p>

<h3>Dermal sensitization</h3>

<p>Dermal sensitization is a type of allergic reaction. It occurs on first exposure to a substance, but on this occasion, the noticeable effect on the skin will be slight or absent. However, subsequent exposure to the same material, or to a similar one with which there is cross-sensitization, produces a severe inflammatory reaction brought about by cells of the immune system (T-lymphocytes).<sup><a href="#reference-7">7</a></sup> The reaction will be represented on the skin as blotchy or redness, which may be painful to some individuals.</p>

<p>The problem with dermal sensitization is that once it occurs with a specific essential oil the individual is most likely going to be sensitive to it for many years and perhaps for the remainder of his/her life. The best way to prevent sensitization is to avoid known dermal sensitizers and avoid applying the same essential oils every day for lengthy periods of time. Sensitization is, to an extent, unpredictable, as some individuals will be sensitive to a potential allergen and some will not.<sup><a href="#reference-8">8</a></sup></p>

<p>According to Burfield (2004), the following oils listed in Table 2 are considered to be dermal sensitizers and are not recommended for use in aromatherapy massage.</p>

<h3>Photosensitization</h3>

<p>An essential oil that exhibits this quality will cause burning or skin pigmentation changes, such as tanning, on exposure to sun or similar light (ultraviolet rays). Reactions can range from a mild color change through to deep weeping burns. <em>Do not use or recommend the use of photosensitizing essential oils prior to going into a sun tanning booth or the sun. Recommend that the client stay out of the sun or sun tanning booth for at least twenty-four hours after treatment if photosensitizing essential oils were applied to the skin.</em> Certain drugs, such as tetracycline, increase the photosensitivity of the skin, thus increasing the harmful effects of photosensitizing essential oils under the necessary conditions.

<p>The use of essential oils during pregnancy is a controversial topic and one that is yet to be fully understood. The main concern during pregnancy appears to be the risk of essential oil constituents crossing over into the placenta. According to Tisserand and Balacs, crossing the placenta does not necessarily mean that there is a risk of toxicity to the fetus; this will depend on the toxicity and the plasma concentration of the compound.<sup><a href="#reference-9">9</a></sup> It is probable that essential oil metabolites cross the placenta due to the intimate (but not direct) contact between maternal and embryonic or fetal blood.<sup><a href="#reference-10">10</a></sup></p>

<p>Jane Buckle comments &ldquo;the use of essential oils in pregnancy is a contentious subject, especially during the vital first 3-month period. It is extremely unlikely that a nightly bath containing a few drops of essential oils will cause any problems for the unborn child&rdquo; and later states &ldquo;there are no records of abnormal fetuses or aborted fetuses due to the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; use of essential oils, either by inhalation or topical application.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#reference-11">11</a></sup></p>

<p>According to Wildwood, &ldquo;A common myth in aromatherapy is that massage oils containing essential oils such as Clary sage, rose or even rosemary can cause a miscarriage and hence should be avoided throughout pregnancy." Authors such as Ron Guba, Kurt Schnaubelt, and Chrissie Wildwood have all pointed out that there have been &lsquo;no recorded cases of miscarriage or birth defect resulting from aromatherapy massage using therapeutic applications of any essential oil.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#reference-12">12</a></sup></p>

<p>Ron Guba points out that toxicity during pregnancy is almost exclusively due to pregnant women taking large, toxic doses of essential oils, notably pennyroyal (rich in the ketone, pulegone, which is metabolized to the highly toxic furan epoxide, menthofuron) and parsley seed (rich in the dimethyl ether, apiol) in an attempt to abort the fetus.<sup><a href="#reference-13">13</a></sup> And Battaglia shares this insight: &ldquo;the judicious use of essential oils together with appropriate forms of massage by a skilled therapist can help ease the discomforts of pregnancy and provide a sense of nurturing that will comfort the mother at times she is likely to be feeling rather fragile.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#reference-14">14</a></sup></p>

<p>Due to the lack of clear information regarding the toxicity of essential oils during pregnancy, it would be best to adhere to general safety guidelines. According to Tisserand and Balacs, the following essential oils should not be used during pregnancy: wormwood, rue, oak moss, <em>Lavandula stoechas</em>, camphor, parsley seed, sage, and hyssop.<sup><a href="#reference-15">15</a></sup></p>

<p>The following properly diluted essential oils appear to be safe for use during pregnancy: benzoin, bergamot, black pepper, chamomile (German &amp; Roman), clary sage, cypress, eucalyptus, frankincense, geranium, ginger, grapefruit, juniper, lavender, lemon, mandarin, majoram (sweet), neroli, petitgrain, rose, sandalwood, orange (sweet), tea tree, ylang ylang.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Clary Sage</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Following the Science with Dr. Jesse Hawkins</h4>

<p>"Clary sage essential is widely recognized as a calming oil that benefits women&#39;s health, especially during the childbearing years. It has long been used to stimulate labor contractions, based on anecdotal reports which range from mild to extreme. The spectrum of claims regarding its effects include mild oxytocin stimulation to support a prolonged labor to the other extreme cautioning against any exposure during pregnancy with warnings it is capable of inducing preterm labor. With such dramatic differences in recommendations and no clear scientific guidelines to follow, it&#39;s no wonder that pregnant clients and even professionals are confused about conflicting safety recommendations. Through a NAHA-supported clinical trial, the Franklin Health team tackled this complex issue through a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial of clary sage during pregnancy. In this session, Dr. Hawkins guides you through the methodological approach taken in this investigation and reveals the first evidence-based guidance for the use of clary sage during pregnancy."</p>

<h3>Essential Oils and Eye Safety</h3>

<p><strong>by Robert Tisserand</strong><br />
<em>(used with permission: <a href="http://www.roberttisserand.com" target="_blank">www.roberttisserand.com</a>)</em></p>

<p>There has been much social media discussion recently (February 2012) about the wisdom or otherwise of putting essential oils into your eyes to treat eye problems. This arose from two webpages, <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/123613-essential-oils-eyes/" target="_blank">here</a> and (2nd page no longer available). One of these, on the Livestrong website, states:</p>

<div class="alert alert-light">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>&ldquo;<em>More and more people are choosing to use alternative medicines to treat minor illnesses rather than taking a prescription. Putting essential oils in or near the eyes isn&rsquo;t something that is widely known about, but there are several that can aid in the treatment of eye problems. Before using essential oils for your eyes, always contact your doctor.</em></p>

<p><em>Clary sage is the essential oil that is most widely used to treat vision problems. It is placed in the eye, so advice from an optometrist is important before use. Clary sage is used as a cleanser for the eyes. It can also be used to clear eye sight due to foggy vision or an injury to the eyes. Clary sage can also be used to brighten the eyes and improve vision. Finally, it can have beneficial results for people with eye issues related to aging.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<footer class="blockquote-footer">Eliza Martinez</footer>

</div>
<span class="figure float-right w-50 ml-2"><img alt="EYE IMAGE" class="img-thumbnail figure-img" src="https://naha.org/assets/uploads/BabyBlueEyesSuprised.jpg" />&nbsp;</span>

<p>This actually dates from May 2010, but judging from the related comments, has only recently been noticed. The statement that <em> &ldquo;Clary sage is the essential oil that is most widely used to treat vision problems&rdquo;</em> is not true, since there are no essential oils commonly used to treat vision problems. The only evidence for any essential oil treating any eye problem relates to tea tree oil and eyelash mites (see below). The reference to clary sage probably derives from 17th century European herbalists, but this refers to using clary sage seeds, or mucilage made from them, and not to clary sage essential oil: &ldquo;The seed put into the eyes clears them from motes and such like things gotten within the lids to offend them, and it also clears them from any white and red spots which may be on them&rdquo; (Culpeper 1652). Another common name for clary sage (<em>Salvia sclarea</em>) was &ldquo;clear eye&rdquo; because of this common use of the seeds, which probably pre-dated Culpeper by many years. &ldquo;Clary&rdquo; may derive from &ldquo;clear-eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not only is there no evidence that any essential oil can help with vision problems, age-related or otherwise, but placing any essential oil &ldquo;in the eye&rdquo; is extremely dangerous advice. Almost any undiluted essential oil coming into contact with the ocular membranes will be corrosive, possibly causing scarring of the cornea, and certainly causing significant pain.</p>

<p>Eye damage I could find no reports in the literature of ocular accidents involving single essential oils, but there are several for Olbas oil. This is a mixture of essential oils and menthol:</p>

<p>35.45% Eucalyptus oil<br />
35.45% Dementholized mint oil<br />
18.5% Cajuput oil<br />
4.1% Menthol<br />
3.7% Wintergreen oil<br />
2.7% Juniper berry oil<br />
0.1% Clove oil</p>

<p>A 2009 report from an ophthalmologist in Bristol UK, describes partial loss of corneal tissue (ie erosion) when a 73-year-old man dripped Olbas Oil into his left eye (he had no right eye) because he thought he was using eye drops (see picture above). He was &ldquo;considerably incapacitated&rdquo;, but recovered after a week of treatment with &ldquo;topical antibiotics and lubricants&rdquo;. On checking, the author found that just his hospital, in the previous 18 months, had seen 12 patients who had mistakenly dripped Olbas Oil into one eye. He describes the result as a chemical burn, though he found that Olbas Oil in tears was pH neutral (most chemical burns are caused by substances that are strongly acid or alkaline). All &ldquo;Olbas Oil patients&rdquo; recovered fully within one week following intensive treatment (Adams et al 2009).</p>

<p>Olbas Oil may cause problems even when not applied directly to the eyes. The mother of a 4-month-old boy placed several drops of Olbas Oil in his right nostril in an attempt to help his respiratory infection, not realizing that the product warns against use in infants. The child immediately showed signs of respiratory distress, and was taken to the emergency room. Two hours after admission his eyes became inflamed, and examination revealed bilateral superficial corneal scarring. He also had conjunctivitis, and could not open his eyes. They were flushed with saline over four days, and he recovered with no residual scarring (Wyllie and Alexander 1994).</p>

<h4>Emergency treatment</h4>

<p>More than 65,000 work-related eye injuries and illnesses are reported annually in the USA, a &ldquo;significant percentage&rdquo; of these being ocular chemical burns. They require rapid treatment, and severe burns have a poor prognosis. The standard treatment is copious irrigation with saline solution for 1-2 hours. Contact lenses should not be removed initially (Peate 2007). With essential oils, fatty oil has been suggested as an appropriate first aid treatment though the advantage of saline is that the eyes can be continually flushed, and this is less easy with fatty oil.</p>

<h4>What about diluted essential oils?</h4>

<p>The second article describes using essential oils diluted to (by my estimation) about 3%. It includes the following advice:<br />
&ldquo;Here is a truly natural solution, which has been shown to benefit your eye health and the only one I will use. Gary Young has used this recipe for his patients at the Ecuador Clinic for macular degeneration, health issues, cataracts, and improving sight. I&rsquo;ve been using it for a couple of years and love it! I started using this recipe before I had to have a vision exam in order to purchase new contacts. And I knew my vision had deteriorated from my last exam. So I put the drops in my eyes every night for about 6 months prior to the exam and my prescription had not changed according to their records, but I know what I was not seeing and I know what I was seeing as a result of using these drops &ndash; clearly my vision had improved! The recipe is as follows:</p>

<p>7-10 drops of Frankincense<br />
7-10 drops of Rosemary<br />
7-10 drops of Cypress<br />
2 Tbsp of V-6</p>

<p>Put oils in a glass dropper bottle with a lid on it. My experience has been that I can see much more clearly just after putting the drops in my eye so I am also going to experiment with putting a drop in my eyes in the morning&rdquo; (Diana Ewald).</p>

<p>&ldquo;V-6&rdquo; is a proprietary blend of vegetable oils. The above implies that using these oils on a daily basis is likely to have a healing effect in cases of cataract, macular degeneration or failing eyesight. Although the article continues to describe various effects of the essential oils, none of them have any relationship with any of these conditions. So the question arises &ndash; how to weigh potential benefits against potential risks?</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; in the above seems appropriate. Eyesight problems are difficult to treat, and once damage has occurred, recovery is not always simple. A 3% dilution may not be sufficient to cause corneal erosion, but on the other hand there is no evidence of any benefit. One concern is that the wrong dilution may be used, and the risk of this is substantial. For example, it would be easy to confuse &ldquo;tbsp&rdquo; with tsp&rdquo;, resulting in a dilution of about 10% instead of 3%.</p>

<p>In a Chinese study, an ointment containing 5% tea tree oil was used by patients whose eyelash follicles were infested with &ldquo;eyelash mites&rdquo; (<em>Demodex folliculorum</em>). The ointment was applied to the lid margins with eyes closed, daily for 4 weeks after washing the face, and resulted in considerably less itching and fewer mites. Two of the 24 patients experienced slight irritation from the ointment. The 5% concentration was arrived at after preliminary testing using various dilutions on rabbit eyes (Gao et al 2012).</p>

<h4>Conclusions</h4>

<p>* Undiluted essential oils should not be applied to the eyes.<br />
* It is rash to suggest that essential oils are commonly used to treat eye problems<br />
* Eye injuries and diseases are medical conditions, and any product claiming to treat them is a medicine, subject to drug legislation.<br />
* There is currently no evidence that applying dilutions of essential oil to the eyes will be beneficial in any condition.<br />
* Diluted (5%) tea tree oil may help eradicate eyelash mites, but it should not be placed into the eyes.</p>
