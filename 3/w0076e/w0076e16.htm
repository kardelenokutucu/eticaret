  Introduction</font></p>
<p>Royal jelly is secreted by the hypopharyngeal gland (sometimes called the brood food
gland) of young worker (nurse) bees, to feed young larvae and the adult queen bee. Royal
jelly is always fed directly to the queen or the larvae as it is secreted; it is not
stored. This is why it has not been a traditional beekeeping product. The only situation
in which harvesting becomes feasible is during queen rearing, when the larvae destined to
become queen bees are supplied with an over-abundance of royal jelly. The queen larvae
cannot consume the food as fast as it is provided and royal jelly accumulates in the queen
cells (see Figure 6.1). The exact definition of commercially available royal jelly is
therefore related to the method of production: it is the food intended for queen bee
larvae that are four to five days old.</p>

<p>The differentiation between queen and worker bees is related to feeding during the
larval stages. Indeed, all female eggs can produce a queen bee, but this occurs only when,
during the whole development of the larvae and particularly the first four days, they are
cared for and fed &quot;like a queen&quot;. Queen rearing, regulated by complex mechanisms
within the hive, induces in a young larva a series of hormonal and biochemical actions and
reactions that make it develop into a queen bee. A queen bee differs from a worker bee in
various ways:</p>

<p><b>in its morphology:</b> the queen develops reproductive organs while the worker bee
develops organs related to its work such as pollen baskets, stronger mandibles, brood food
glands and wax glands. </p>

<p><b>in its development period:</b> on average the queen develops in <i>15.5 </i>days
while worker bees require 21 days.</p>

<p><b>in its life span:</b> the queen lives for several years as compared to a few months
for the worker bee,</p>

<p><b>and its behaviour:</b> the queen lays up to several thousand eggs a day while
workers lay eggs only occasionally. Unlike workers, the queen never participates in any
common hive activities.</p>

<p>It is mainly the spectacular fertility and long life-span of the queen, exclusively fed
on royal jelly, which have suggestively led people to believe that royal jelly produces
similar effects in humans. In the early <i>1950's, </i>articles began to appear,
particularly in the French beekeeping press, in praise of the virtues of royal jelly,
referring to research conducted in several hospitals. Chauvin (1968) however, was unable
to find the source of such information and therefore considered it unfounded.</p>

<p>The myth of royal jelly started with an amazing biological phenomenon on the one hand
and commercial speculation on the other, which, on the basis of initial results obtained
by entomologists and physiologists, exploited the suggestibility and imagination of
consumers willing to be seduced by the fascination of this rare and unknown product was
exploited. In fact, royal jelly was so rare and so little known that it was impossible to
verify its actual presence in many products claiming its content.</p>

<p>In the years immediately following its first marketing, royal jelly quickly became
widely known and consumed and the increasing demand motivated experts to refine production
techniques and led more and more beekeepers to specialize in this activity. At the same
time, research on quality control of the commercial product and identification of its
biological and clinical properties found growing support.</p>

<p>Consumption of royal jelly has been growing ever since, even without its benefit to
human health having ever been scientifically confirmed. The Western medical establishment
has always been wary of the effects claimed for this product and in most cases refuses to
consider it, largely because of the way royal jelly was initially promoted. In spite of a
vast number of publications praising its virtues and the apparently abundant bibliography,
there is still a serious lack of scientific data on the clinical effects of royal jelly.</p>

  Physical characteristics of royal jelly</font></p>
<p>Royal jelly is a homogeneous substance with the consistency of a fairly fluid paste. It
is whitish in colour with yellow or beige tinges, has a pungent phenolic odour and a
characteristic sour flavour. It has a density of approximately 1.1 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>(Lercker
et al., 1992) and is partially soluble in water. Aqueous solutions clarify during
basification with soda.</p>

<p>Viscosity varies according to water content and age - it slowly becomes more viscous
when stored at room temperature or in a refrigerator at <i>5<sup>0</sup>C. </i>The
increased viscosity appears to be related to an increase in water insoluble nitrogenous
compounds, together with a reduction in soluble nitrogen and free amino acids (Takenaka et
al., 1986). These changes are apparently due to continued enzymatic activities and
interaction between the lipid and protein fractions. If sucrose is added, royal jelly
becomes more fluid (Sasaki et al., 1987). Such changes in viscosity have also been related
to the phenomena which regulate caste differentiation in a bee colony (see also 6.4.1).</p>

<p>Certain debris in royal jelly, is a sign of purity as, for example, the ever present
fragments of laarval skin (see also 6.8). Wax fragments too, are encountered more or less
regularly, but their presence is largely dependent on the collection method. Stored royal
jelly often develops small granules due to precipitation of components.</p>

  The composition of royal jelly</font></p>
<p>Numerous chemical analyses of royal jelly have been published over the years. Only
recently though, have highly refined technologies given detailed analyses of the unusual
composition and complexity of this somewhat acidic substance (pH 3.6 to 4.2).</p>

<p>The principal constituents of royal jelly are water, protein, sugars, lipids and
mineral salts. Although they occur with notable variations (Table 6.1) the composition of
royal jelly remains relatively constant when comparing different colonies, bee races and
time.</p>

<p>Water makes up about two thirds of fresh royal jelly, but by dry weight, proteins and
sugars are by far the largest fractions. Of the nitrogenous substances, proteins average
73.9% and of the six major proteins (Otani et al., 1985) four are glycoproteins (Takenaka,
1987). Free amino acids average 2.3% and peptides 0.16% (Takenaka, 1984) of the
nitrogenous substances. All amino acids essential for humans are present and a total of 29
amino acids and derivatives have been identified, the most important being aspartic acid
and glutamic acid (Howe et al., <i>1985). </i>The free amino acids are proline and lysine
(Takenaka, 1984 and 1987). A number of enzymes are also present including glucose oxidase
(Nye et al., 1973) phosphatase and cholinesterase (Ammon and Zoch, 1957).<b> </b>An
insulin-like substance has been identified by Kramer et al. (1977 and 1982).</p>

<p>The sugars consist mostly of fructose and glucose in relatively constant proportions
similar to those in honey. Fructose is prevalent. In many cases fructose and glucose
together account for 90% of the total sugars. The sucrose content varies considerably from
one sample to another. Other sugars present in much lower quantities are maltose,
trehalose, melibiose, ribose and erlose (Lercker et al., 1984, 1986 and 1992).</p>

<p>The lipid content is a unique and from many points of view, a very interesting feature
of royal jelly. The lipid fraction consists to 80-90% (by dry weight) of free fatty acids
with unusual and uncommon structures. They are mostly short chain (8 to 10 carbon atoms)
hydroxy fatty acids or dicarboxylic acids, in contrast to the fatty acids with 14 to 20
carbon atoms which are commonly found in animal and plant material. These fatty acids are
responsible for most of the recorded biological properties of royal jelly (Schmidt and
Buchmann, 1992). The principal acid is 10-hydroxy-2-decanoic acid, followed by its
saturated equivalent, lO-hydroxydecanoic acid. In addition to the free fatty acids, the
lipid fraction contains some neutral lipids, sterols (including cholesterol) and an
unsaponifiable fraction of hydrocarbons similar to beeswax extracts (Lercker et al., 1981,
1982, 1984 and 1992).</p>

<p>The total ash content of royal jelly is about 1 % of fresh weight or 2 to 3 % of dry
weight. The major mineral salts are, in descending order: K, Ca, Na, Zn, Fe, Cu and Mn,
with a strong prevalence of potassium (Benfenati et al., 1986).</p>

<p>The vitamin content has been the object of numerous studies, from the moment when the
first research (Aeppler, 1922) showed that royal jelly is extremely rich in vitamins.
Table 6.2 indicates the results obtained by Vecchi et al., (1988) with regard to
water-soluble vitamins. Other authors report averages close to the minimum values of Table
6.2 (Schmidt and Buchmann, 1992). Only traces of vitamin C can be found.</p>

<p>As far as the fat-soluble vitamins are concerned, it was initially thought that, given
the enormous fertility of the queen bee, royal jelly would contain vitamin E. But tests
have shown that it does not. Vitamins A, D and K are also absent (Melampy and Jones,
1939).</p>

<p>During the first studies, much emphasis was placed on the search for sex hormones in
royal jelly. The first positive tests were later proven wrong. Melampy and Stanley (1940)
showed no gonadotropic effects on female rats and Johansson and Johansson (1958) clearly
demonstrated the absence of any human sex hormones. Recently though, with much more
sensitive radio-immunological methods, testosterone has been identified in extremely small
quantities: 0.012 ~g/g fresh weight (Vittek and Slomiany, 1984). In comparison, a human
male produces daily 250,000 to 1 million times the amount present in one gram of fresh
royal jelly (Schmidt and Buchmann, 1992). No biological effect has been demonstrated for
such small amounts.</p>

<p>Numerous minor compounds, belonging to diverse chemical categories, have been
identified in royal jelly. Among these are two heterocyclic substances, biopterine and
neopterine at 25 and 5 ijg/g of fresh weight respectively. These compounds are found in
the food of worker bee larvae too, but at about one tenth of these concentration (Rembold,
1965). Other substances identified include several nucleotides as free bases (adenosine,
uridine, guanosine, iridin and cytidine) the phosphates AMP, ADP, and ATP (Marko et al.,
1964), acetylcholine (1 mglg dry weight, Henschler, 1954) and gluconic acid (0.6% of fresh
weight, Nye et al., 1973).</p>

<p>In all popular and scientific literature, there is a fraction of royal jelly described
as &quot;other, as yet unknown&quot;. This phrase not only emphasizes the incomplete state
of analytical knowledge about the product, but also the lack of understanding of the
biological activities (proven or presumed) of royal jelly. Up to now, despite many
efforts, most of these activities have not been proven definitely, nor have they been
attributed to any of the known components.</p>

  On honevbees</p>
</b> 
<p>The effect of royal jelly on honeybee larvae, for which it was originally intended as
food, is briefly described since in addition to being a fascinating biological phenomenon,
it is also the basis of the royal jelly &quot;myth&quot;.</p>

<p>In the 1950's, in the wake of new discoveries in the medical field of such wonder drugs
as penicillin, hormones and vitamins became &quot;popular&quot; and were seen by many as
the simple answers to many biological questions. The elusive &quot;hormonal&quot; effect
of royal jelly on honeybee larvae led to the belief that its almost miraculous action on
bee larvae could be similar on humans.</p>

<p>By deduction these &quot;hormonal&quot; effects were not only responsible for the caste
differentiation between worker and queen bee, but also for the enormous fertility of a
queen genetically equal to a worker bee, distinguished apparently only by the food it ate.
The same applies to the queen's longevity, unique for an adult insect. Though it is known
that royal jelly is a necessary food for the queen's survival and productivity, it is not
known which royal jelly fractions are essential, which ones can be replaced and what
constitutes minimum or optimum requirements for a queen. Almost all the attention has been
focused on the immature stages of development.</p>

<p>Numerous studies were carried out to discover hormones or other substances powerful
enough to induce all the necessary changes and give the queen such &quot;superior&quot;
qualities. Indeed, the initial studies led to the belief that a &quot;queen
determinator&quot; did exist and was an extremely unstable substance (as elusive as
eternal life). It appeared to be so unstable that one day after secretion, it was already
ineffective. However, the results of other studies did not confirm this hypothesis.</p>

<p>In an attempt to identify the queen determinator, all the components of royal jelly,
particularly the more unusual ones or those with known biological activity or present in
greater quantity have been tested. In the late 1980's the mystery had still not been
solved and a number of contrasting hypotheses had produced equally convincing
explanations. Rembold et al. (1974) ware thought to have been close to identifying a
specific substance with queen determinator activity which they had isolated; other
researchers proposed a differentiation mechanism based on the different proportions of
nutrients in the food of worker and queen bee larvae. Weiss (1975) and Asencot and Lensky
(1975) believed it was the sugar content of larval food (higher for the young queen bee
larvae) that was supposed to cause the differentiation into queens.</p>

<p>More recently, Sasaki et al. (1987) proposed yet another hypothesis incorporating the
many contrasting results from other researchers and suggested the &quot;correct&quot;
viscosity of royal jelly was a key factor together with higher consumption, but even this
theory still has to be substantiated with proof. In other words, it is still not known how
royal jelly works nor what is responsible for its amazing effects.</p>

<p>However, if parallels are still being drawn between honeybees and royal jelly, and
humans and royal jelly, then they should serve to emphasize the complexity and
interdependence of different therapies and factors such as who is taking what, when and
how much. Eating royal jelly, or rubbing it into the skin will not make anyone younger or
live for a thousand years. On the other hand, using it to supplement and support other
diets, activities or medicines may have synergistic effects which cannot be explained by a
list of compounds and their individual effects. Tests of such a hypothesis in clinical and
scientific trials are needed. There is plenty of circumstantial evidence, reviewed in the
following section, that leads us to believe that royal jelly might be highly beneficial to
mankind.</p>

  Unconfirmed circumstantial evidence</p>
</b> 
<p>Royal jelly was initially advertised for its rejuvenating effects (De Belfever, 1958).
The activities most frequently reported in advertisements and constantly confirmed in the
declarations of those who have taken royal jelly are indicated in Table 6.3, citing the
contents of one of Europe's most widespread and popular publication on the subject
(Donadieu, 1978). Royal jelly, taken orally for 1-2 months by swallowing or letting it
melt under the tongue in doses of 200-500 mg a day, is said to act as a tonic and
stimulant, with a euphoric effect on healthy humans.</p>

<p>In addition to these indications, users declared that royal jelly had solved most of
their health problems. In many cases these were chronic or recurring disorders, for which
other treatments did not lead to the desired results, so that the effects obtained by
taking royal jelly have been considered &quot;miraculous&quot;.</p>

<p>It must be emphasised that these claims are unconfirmed by any scientific studies or
documentation. There is no proof that the effects are exclusively or even mostly
attributable to royal jelly.</p>

<p>People who have taken royal jelly said that they soon experienced a feeling of general
well-being, i.e. an effect on their physical output (resistance to fatigue), intellectual
performance (greater learning capacity and better memory) and on their mental condition
(greater self-confidence, feeling of well-being and euphoria). In other words, royal jelly
appears to act as a general stimulant, improving immune response and general body
functions.</p>

<p>Royal jelly is neither toxic when injected into mice and rats at high dosages of up to

jelly administration in early years, have been completely abandoned (even under strict
medical supervision) because of the risk of serious allergic reactions (Dillon and
Louveaux, 1987) Today, royal jelly is most often administered orally and externally (in
cosmetics).</p>

<p>In vitro studies have confirmed that lO-hydroxydecanoic acid in royal jelly has
antibiotic activity. The antibiotic effectiveness is thermostable, i.e. is not destroyed
by moderate heating, but it decreases with improper or long-term storage. Antibiotic
action has been proven against the following microorganisms: <u>Escherichia coli,</u> <u>Salmonella,</u>
<u>Proteus, Bacillus subtilis</u> and <u>Staphylococcus aureus</u> (Lavie, 1968; Yatsunami
and Echigo, 1985). It shows one quarter of the activity of penicillin against <u>Micrococcus
pyrogens</u> and is also fungicidal (Blum et al., 1959). In vitro, antiviral effects have
been described (Derivici and Petrescu, 1965) and better resistance to viral infections has
been observed in mice.</p>

<p>This same antibiotic action of fatty acids is neutralized by raising the pH above 5.6.
Since injection into blood, muscle or the peritoneal cavity will raise the pH to 7.4, and
the pH is above 5.6 in the intestines, the therapeutic value of the anti-bacterial
activity of fatty acids is likely to be negligible for any internal applications, but will
remain effective for topical use.</p>

<p>In studies on the internal effects of royal jelly with live animals or humans the jelly
is usually administered either by mouth or by injection. The latter allows better
assessment of hormonal activities ascribed to royal jelly but carries a substantial risk
of allergic reactions.</p>
<b><u>

<p>Oral administration</p>
</u></b>

<p>Positive effects on reproductivity, though not necessarily due to hormone-like action,
have been reported at least for chickens, quails and rabbits. Rabbits reacted to a normal
diet supplemented with 100-200 mg of royal jelly per kilogramme of body weight with
increased fertility and embryonic development (Khattab et al., 1989). Japanese quail
reached sexual maturity sooner and laid more eggs after supplementation of diets with high
doses (0.2 g) of lyophilized (freeze-dried) royal jelly (Csuka et al., 1978). Bonomi
(1983) increased egg production, fertility and hatching in laying hens by using 5 mg royal
jelly per kg of feed, but Giordani (1961) found no histological changes in male or female
reproductive organs or weight gain with higher doses of 10 to 40 mg per day.</p>

<p>Growth rates of mice slightly increased with a dosage of 1 g of royal jelly per kg of
feed, but decreased with higher dosages (Chauvin, 1968). Bonomi (1983) reported weight
increases in chicken, partridges and pheasants with a supplement of S mg royal jelly per
kg of feed and Salama et al. (1977) reported weight increases in rats when 10, 20 or 40 mg
were injected directly into their stomachs. The administration of 0.02 g of royal jelly to
calves less than 7 days old gave a weight gain of 11 - 13 % during the following 6 months
in comparison with untreated controls (Radu-Todurache et al., 1978). They also mentioned
that the treated calves showed lower mortality and higher resistance to infection.</p>

<b><u>

<p>Injections</p>
</u></b>

<p>Intravenous injections cause slight vasodilation (temporary enlarging of blood vessels)
and have a hypotensive effect (lowering blood pressure); both due to acetylcholine in
royal jelly (Jacoli, 1956; Shinoda et al., 1978).</p>

<p>Injections of royal jelly solutions induced higher blood sugar levels than oral
applications (Chauvin, 1968). No hypoglycemic (insulin-like) reaction could be shown in
rats (Fujii et al., 1990). Afifi et al. (1989) reported weight increases in guinea pigs
after injection of 100-300 ing royal jelly per kilogramme of body weight. Small doses
injected into cats raised haemoglobin and erythrocyte counts and repeated doses of up to
10 mg/kg of body weight stimulated motor activity and weight gains in mice. Repeated
higher doses of 100 mg/kg in mice, however, caused weight loss and impaired
cerebrocortical (brain cortex) cellular metabolism (Lupachev, 1963).</p>
<b><u>

<p>Animal tests</p>
</u></b>

<p>In other studies human diseases were simulated in animals in order to identify the
mechanisms of royal jelly action. Thus it is known that royal jelly can reduce blood
plasma levels of cholesterol and triglycerides (Cho, 1977) and cholesterol and arterial
cholesterol deposits in rabbits when these disorders were induced experimentally (Carli et
al. 1975). Nakajin et al., (1982) stated that although royal jelly has no effect on lipid
levels in blood plasma in normal rabbits, it can reduce the cholesterol content in the
blood of animals fed on a diet which induced high levels of blood cholesterol.</p>

<p>Vittek and Halmos (1968) found that royal jelly promoted bone healing in rabbits. The
healing of skin lesions was accelerated and anti-inflammatory action was shown for rats by
Fujii et al. (1990).</p>

<p>Other researchers tested royal jelly and some of its compounds on tumour cell cultures,
showing the inhibitory action of lO-hydroxydecanoic acid (Townsend et al., 1960) and
certain dicarboxylic acids. However, they also showed that the same acids could induce
tumours in mice when royal jelly is mixed with the culture medium (several mg/ml at less
than pH 5) prior to injection into the test animals (Morgan et al., 1960). Wagner et al.,
(1970) found no significant effects of prolonged survival in mice irradiated against
experimentally induced tumours and treated with royal jelly (20 mg/kg of body weight) as
compared to control mice which did not receive any royal jelly. More recently, Tamura et
al., (1987) have shown tumour growth inhibition in mice with prophylactic and therapeutic
oral administration of royal jelly. Inhibition of rapid-growth cancers (leukaemia) was
insignificant but it was noticeable on slow-growing, solid tumours (Ehrlich and Sarcoma
strains).</p>
<b><u>

<p>Human tests</p>
</u></b>

<p>Studies of the effects of royal jelly on humans are extremely numerous, particularly in
Eastern Europe. A few early studies were presented in Russian by Braines (1959, 1960 and
1962). Most studies however, arc difficult to evaluate for the scientific value of the
reported information. Although many are presented as scientific publications, they often
lack details on test methods, use parameters difficult to quantify (well-being, euphoria
and rejuvenation) do not entirely exclude effects from other concurrent treatments, or use
subject numbers too small to exclude accidental effects or natural variation. Of all the
works consulted and selected for this chapter, of which a few are summarized in Table 6.4,
not one is totally without criticism. The information presented therefore must be
considered only as an indication of possible effects requiring further clinical testing.</p>

<p>The mechanisms of royal jelly's activity is not known and none of the numerous
hypotheses have been confirmed. An early explanation (Johansson and Johansson, 1958)
claiming high vitamin content as a contributory factor can be refuted on the grounds that
the same effects should then be achievable with vitamin supplements or a glass of milk,
which contains amounts of vitamins similar to the usual dose of royal jelly. Beneficial
effects on intestinal flora through selected anti-microbial action can mostly be excluded
due to pH. The action of some compounds on endocrine glands, or becoming part of enzyme
systems or directly affecting intermediate metabolism has been suggested by Bonomi (1983).</p>

  Uses and marketing of royal jelly</font></p>
<p>Royal jelly can be sold in its fresh state, unprocessed except for being frozen or
cooled, mixed with other products, or freeze-dried for further use in other preparations.
The fresh production and sale can be handled by enterprises of all sizes since no special
technology is required. In its unprocessed form it can also be included directly in many
food and dietary supplements as well as medicine-like products or cosmetics. For larger
industrial scale use, royal jelly is preferred in its freeze-dried form, because of easier
handling and storing. Freeze-dried royal jelly can be included in the same products as the
fresh form. The production of freeze-dried royal jelly requires an investment of at least
US$ 10,000 for a freeze-dryer, sufficient production volume and an accessible market for
the raw material or its value added products. The discussion below describes some of the
value added products in which royal jelly has been included in the past.</p>

<p>Since the assumed benefits of royal jelly have not been sufficiently proven, 
  statements in advertisements and on package labels should be very careful to 
  avoid suggestions which are not well-founded. Any kind of fraudulent or exaggerated 
  statements and claims are in the long run more damaging than any short-term 
  benefit that may be derived from, for example, an increase in the price of a 
  product. Products containing royal jelly should be specially marked or packaged 
  in order to distinguish them from similar products without it.</p>

  As dietary supplement</p>
</b> 
<p>Royal jelly belongs to a group of products generically described as &quot;dietary
supplements&quot; These are products which are consumed not for their caloric content nor
for pleasure, but to supplement the normal diet with substances in which it might be
lacking. In reality, however, the use of royal jelly is not so much linked to its high
content in &quot;noble&quot; substances, but to its assumed stimulant and therapeutic
value. However, it cannot be defined as a medicine because the data required for
classification in this category are lacking. If it were declared a medicine, its use would
become dependant on medical prescriptions and the production and marketing of royal
jelly-based products would become the exclusive domain of the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

<p>A large amount of royal jelly is sold and consumed as it is harvested. In its
unprocessed, natural state, it is preferred by most producers, because it does not require
any special technology, and by consumers because of its unaltered &quot;naturalness&quot;.
The fact that its taste is not very pleasant, instead of deterring consumers appears to
enhance its image as a &quot;medicine&quot;. For those who do not appreciate this
particular medicinal aspect, royal jelly can be mixed with a little honey, sugar syrup or
water, or it may be encapsulated.</p>

<p>Unprocessed royal jelly is usually packaged in small, dark glass bottles of sizes that
correspond to the duration of a &quot;treatment&quot; e.g. 10, 15 or 20 g. A tiny plastic
spatula is usually included for the &quot;correct&quot; dosage of 250 - 500 mg (see Figure
6.2) Special isothermal packaging (usually a moulded polystyrene box) is sometimes used to
make the product look even more precious and protect it perhaps from brief temperature
fluctuations. In Italy, in the past, it was also sold in special glass syringes, allowing
more precise dosages and giving greater protection against oxidation.</p>

<p>Producers also sell pure royal jelly in its original queen cells after having removed
the larvae and sealed the cells. The cells may be sealed with another wax queen cell cup,
with liquid wax or by squeezing the ends of the cell together. The queen cells thus
prepared can be packaged in small plastic boxes or glass jars together with a small
spatula. The main disadvantage of this type of packaging is that the royal jelly does not
keep well (two weeks in a refrigerator or a few months when frozen immediately) and only
sells well directly from the producer to the consumer. On the other hand such sales can be
extremely profitable and are also attractive to consumers who can be sure that the product
is untreated and fresh. Given the normal variation in content of queen cells the net
weight must be given for the smallest possible quantity (e.g. minimum content 250
mg/cell).</p>

<p>Royal jelly sold in any of the above forms must always be kept at or below 5~ C during
storage, during transportation and in the retail store. Empty packages can be displayed
while full containers are stored in a refrigerator.</p>

  As ingredient in food products</p>
</b> 
<p>A mixture of royal jelly in honey (1-3 % royal jelly) is probably the most common way
in which royal jelly is used as a food ingredient. Among the advantages of this product
are that no special technology is required and the honey masks any visible changes in the
royal jelly. The final product is pleasant-tasting and it provides the beneficial effects
of both products. One teaspoon of the mixture typically contains 100 - 300 mg of royal
jelly, about the dosage of royal jelly that is most commonly recommended. Nothing is known
however about the preservation of royal jelly in such a mixture. It should, therefore, be
kept refrigerated.</p>

<p>Another food frequently enriched with royal jelly in some European countries is yogurt,
which has an acidity similar to royal jelly and also requires refrigeration. Yoghurt is
already a popular food for health-conscious consumers who often appreciate its further
enrichment with royal jelly. The higher price that is usually charged reflects what the
market will bear rather than the extra production costs, i.e. the market value added to
such a product by the royal jelly is higher than the cost of the jelly and extra
production costs.</p>

<p>Sometimes, vitamin supplements and fruit juices are enriched with freeze dried royal
jelly. Royal jelly is widely used in beverages in Asia.</p>

<p>Royal jelly is also sold in a jelly made of honey, sugar, jam and pectin. Though simple
enough to produce, there are no data available on the durability or residual efficacy of
royal jelly presented in this way.</p>

  As ingredient in medicine-like products</p>
</b> 
<p>This category of products resembles medicines as far as their form of presentation is
concerned, but in other respects these products are no different from the dietary
supplements and foods described in the two preceding sections. However, they require more
advanced technology for production and packaging and make higher demands on product
stability as well as quality control. For the same reasons, many of these applications use
freeze dried royal jelly. Unfortunately, the pricing of these products does not always
reflect the quality of the product and many are grossly overpriced.</p>

<p>In medicine-like formulations royal jelly is generally included for its stimulatory
effects. However, it is also used to solve specific health problems. A variety of
formulations are available, often containing ingredients otherwise used to alleviate
particular afflictions. As has been seen in an earlier section, there is no solid
scientific base for any such uses. Advertising or other popular information should
therefore be treated with great caution and royal jelly should never be used as a
substitute for other treatments unless the treatment has been approved by a competent
physician.</p>

<p>Whether royal jelly is the only active ingredient, or is mixed with others, 
  the basic forms of presentation remain the same and are adapted to the desired 
  applications or consumer preferences. Dosages may be presented in any of the 
  following ways (see Figure 6.3):</p>

<p>- as a single dose package of dry royal jelly with separate solvent, <br>
- as a single dose of mixed pulverized ingredients with or without solvent and in tablet
or capsule form, <br>
- as a single or multiple dose liquid solution for oral administration or injection</p>

<p>Single-dosage packages generally have to use a filler to bring the dose of the active
ingredient (royal jelly or the ingredient mix) to a volume that can be easily handled by
the consumer. An envelope containing only 250 mg of freeze-dried royal jelly would look
very empty and the powder it contained might easily be lost. Sugar, salt, aromas, citric
acid, glycine, a.o. may all serve as fillers (see Figure 6.4). As well as being mere
fillers, they often render the product more pleasant to taste. Additional ingredients
mixed with royal jelly are often other food supplements like plant extracts (ginseng),
yeasts, pollen extracts and others.</p>

<p>Most packages provide the dry phase in a separate package, envelope or vial and a
solvent in an appropriate container. Not only does this separation allow more effective
treatment of the liquid phase (such as pasteurization or sterilization) but it also
improves storage life and therefore facilitates shipping and marketing. Some refined
packaging contains the dry phase in a special lid which upon opening releases the powder
into the solvent.</p>

<p>In tablet form, the principal excipient is usually a powdered sugar plus a binding
agent such as gum arabic (for simple recipes see 5.16.5 and 6.11.7). For larger
production, tableting machines are necessary which can sometimes be purchased second-hand
at reasonable prices. Hard and soft gelatine capsules can be used for similar
formulations. The hard capsules can be filled by hand on a small scale or by machine on a
more industrial level (see also Figures 3.10 and 3.11), but soft capsules and gelatine
drops need expensive equipment and are usually manufactured only by larger enterprises or
under contract by large enterprises for third parties.</p>

<p>Another form of presentation is in vials with a liquid solution of royal jelly. These
are simple to prepare and can use fresh unprocessed royal jelly, but they present
preservation problems both with regard to microbiological activity and the long-term
stability of the royal jelly. The addition of a little alcohol or propolis extract
increases protection against microbial growth. Such preparations are distributed widely
and are now being imported mostly from Asia by Europe, the USA and some Latin American
countries . One of the more common formulations contains honey, royal jelly and an alcohol
extract of ginseng (see Figure 6.10). Since these products are not regulated as food or as
medicines, they are not required to list all ingredients, particularly the different
preservatives which are necessary in these liquid formulations.</p>

<p>The production of injectable royal jelly preparations must be left to qualified
laboratories in order to avoid problems with contamination and toxicity. There are patents
that protect the production of royal jelly extracts for human use (by injection), but up
to now there is no actual production or use for these &quot;medicines&quot;, at least in
Western Europe.</p>

<p>The medicinal or pseudo-medicinal use of royal jelly is much more popular in Asia and
Eastern Europe, where rules on medicinal formulations and applications are very different
from those in Western Europe and North America. In Africa, very little use of royal jelly
has been reported, either as a food supplement or as medicine.</p>

  As ingredient in cosmetics</p>
</b> 
<p>Except in Asia, probably the largest use of royal jelly is in cosmetics. Royal jelly is
included in many dermatological preparations, but mostly in those used for skin
refreshing, and skin regeneration or rejuvenation. It is also used in creams or ointments
for healing burns and other wounds. It is usually included in very small dosages <i>(0.05 </i>to
1 %) but it is likely that it deteriorates relatively quickly. No precise data on loss of
effectiveness are available. The freeze-dried form of royal jelly is usually preferred
because of ease of handling. A royal jelly/lactose paste mixed at 0<sup>0</sup>C is said
to stabilize royal jelly (Rubinsstein, 1954). The paste can then be added to cosmetic
preparations. More information and recipes can be found in Chapter 9.</p>

  Others</p>
</b> 
<p>The only other known uses for royal jelly are in animal nutrition. In particular, royal
jelly has occasionally been used (fresh or freeze-dried) to stimulate race horses. For
experimental purposes it is also used as a food for rearing mites and insects.</p>

  Royal jelly collection</font></p>
<p>Royal jelly is produced by stimulating colonies to produce queen bees outside the
conditions in which they would naturally do so (swarming and queen replacement). It
requires very little investment but is only possible with movable comb hives. Expert
personnel are required, who are able to devote considerably more time than is commonly
required for the production of other bee products. Without this prerequisite it is
possible to only occasionally collect the contents from cells of natural swarms - and this
amounts to no more than a gram or two per hive.</p>

<p>A well-managed hive during a season of 5-6 months can produce approximately SOOg of
royal jelly. Since the product is perishable, producers must have immediate access to
proper cold storage (e.g. a household refrigerator or freezer) in which the royal jelly is
stored until it is sold or conveyed to a collection centre.</p>

<p>The most rational and economic methods for large scale production are variations of the
Doolittle method of queen rearing. Usually, the starter colony is omitted and cell cups,
with transferred larvae, are directly introduced into the finisher colonies. Strong
queenright colonies are preferred, in which the queen chamber is separated from the cell
rearing chamber by a queen excluder. The only required adaptation is to shorten the cycle
in the finishing colonies (3 days versus 10) before cells are removed for harvesting
(Figure <i>6.5). </i>For occasional and small scale production any other queen rearing
method can be used. However, there are many queen rearing methods which differ only in
hive design and the use of starter and/or finisher colonies. For more details, it is
recommended that the reader consult a regular beekeeping text or better, one specialized
in queen rearing. Recommended English texts are Laidlaw, 1979; Laidlaw, 1992 and Ruttner,
1983.</p>

<p>The basic requirements are movable comb hives, preferably some queen excluders, queen
cups (made from wax or plastic), a transfer needle, a spoon or suction device to remove
royal jelly, dark glass vials and a refrigerator. Special hive modifications may
facilitate the work according to personal preferences, and centrifugal extractors for
royal jelly may be used for large scale production. Feeding with sugar syrup (1:1 in
sugar/water) increases cell acceptance, even when flowers are available.</p>

<p>Individual queen cells should not contain less than 200 mg of royal jelly. Low cell
content means that there are too many cells for the finisher colony or that the colony is
not in a condition to provide for queen rearing. There are racial differences in
productivity and specially selected strains can be obtained. However, importing queens may
not guarantee higher production in a different environment and carries a considerable risk
of importing new or resistant diseases, thus reducing productivity and economic
feasibility.</p>

<p>Mature queen cells, i.e. those with larvae four days old (3 days after grafting), must
be brought quickly into the extraction room. The open, narrow part of the cells is cut to
facilitate and speed up collection. Then the larvae are removed with a pair of soft
forceps, taking care not to harm them and contaminate the jelly. The royal jelly is
extracted by emptying each cell with a small spatula, by sucking it up with a special
mouth operated device, with a pump operated device or by centrifugal extraction (see
Figure 6.6). Following extraction, the cells are immediately ready for another rearing
cycle.</p>

<p>The royal jelly must be filtered using a fine nylon net (nylon stockings are excellent)
to eliminate fragments of wax and larvae. Metal filters should not be used. The jelly
should be placed into dark glass vials or food-grade plastic containers, avoiding any
excessive exposure to air. It should be refrigerated immediately. Any material or
equipment contacting royal jelly - including hands - must be clean and disinfected using
heat or pure alcohol. The laboratory must be kept impeccably clean and extraction should
never be done outside or in sunlight.</p>

<p>The commercial production of royal jelly requires a methodical approach, good
organization and precise timing. Constant attendance is essential as one day off can
eliminate two days of production. In order to have a weekly day of rest (e.g. Sunday) no
queen cells would be introduced on Thursday, which means that there will also be no
collection on the following Wednesday.</p>

<p>These techniques are suitable for both small and quite large enterprises. Depending on
the intended market, the approach can be either one of low cost or one in which all
collecting, processing and distribution takes place in highly controlled environments. The
latter will result in a product which is better suited for industrial use (see also
section 6.11.1).</p>

  Storage</font></p>
<p>Royal jelly has a limited shelf-life. Early beliefs in the extreme instability of royal
jelly activity, based on the alleged rapid loss of the &quot;queen determination&quot;
factor (see 6.4.1) have not been confirmed. Since neither the mode of activity nor the
actual effects of royal jelly are known, there are no data available on changes in its
biological effectiveness on humans after long term storage.</p>

<p>Information is, however, available on changes in composition due to long term storage,
such as a higher acid titre, a large unsoluble protein fraction, less free amino acids,
less glucose oxidase and others (Takenaka et., 1986 and Karaali et al, 1988). Such changes
make it appear likely that also biological activity is influenced by storage.
Refrigeration and freezing delay and reduce the chemical changes. Although freeze-dried
jelly is the most staable form of royal jelly, some changes still take place.</p>

<p>On the basis of the above, we can conclude that refrigeration of royal jelly at 0~ to 5
<sup>0</sup>C is a minimum precaution. Still better is storage, whenever possible, at
temperatures below -17<sup>0</sup>C, which is attainable in most household freezers. Since
royal jelly is an emulsified product and not cellular tissue, freezing presents no
particular problem and common household freezers can be used.</p>

<p>As there are no criteria for establishing &quot;safety&quot; limits for product
activity, storage and shelf-life should be kept as brief as possible. For products sold in
Europe, the average recommended storage time after production is 18 months under
refrigeration. For products stored at - <b>170 </b>C, storage can be extended to 24
months. After defrosting and packaging, the product should not be stored in a refrigerator
for more than 12 months.</p>

<p>Freeze-dried royal jelly and royal jelly based products are generally stored at room
temperature, sometimes for several years. Freeze-dried royal jelly is certainly more
stable than the fresh product, but it was reported that only during the first two months
of storage at room temperature no signs were observed of any deterioration (Okada et al.,
1977). Therefore, also in this case cold storage is recommended to minimise changes and
products should be kept on the shelf for as short a time as possible.</p>

<p>The storage recommendations for fresh and dried royal jelly are valid in the same way
for all wet or dry products to which royal jelly has been added. Contrary to many
recommendations on packages, these products should be stored in the same manner as the
pure, fresh jelly.</p>

<p>In 1956, a French patent was granted for a method of stabilizing royal jelly by mixing
it with an easily assimilable, adsorbent substance such as a carbohydrate or protein. A
homogenised paste of 10 g fresh royal jelly with 100 g of lactose, mixed at 0<sup>0</sup>C
was proposed by Jean <i>(1956). </i>However, no evaluation or verification of increased
shelf-life is available. Such support substances, often sugars but also glycine are
frequently used to increase the volume of single doses of freeze-dried royal jelly, to
make handling easier for both packers (weighing of very small quantities is both difficult
and imprecise) and customers.</p>

<p>Like all other bee products, royal jelly has its own microbiological protection 
  and presents few microbiological storage problems when it is in its natural 
  state. This protection however is not absolute and certain hygiene precautions 
  must be observed during production (section 6.6) and storage. Hygienic working 
  conditions and clean containers are a minimum requirement, and airtight containers 
  should be used to provide additional protection not only against contamination 
  but also against oxidation.</p>
